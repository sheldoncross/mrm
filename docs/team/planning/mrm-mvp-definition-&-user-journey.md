# **MRM: MVP Definition & User Journey**

## **1\. Target Persona**

* **Role:** Generalist Software Developer (Not an ML Specialist)  
* **Context:** Works on an independent team within a large organization or at a mid-size company.  
* **Core Task:** Tasked with deploying and maintaining a machine learning model in a production environment.

## **2\. The "Moment of Truth": High-Stakes Business Scenarios**

*While the developer's immediate pain is technical (e.g., performance drift), the ultimate business value of our product is mitigating catastrophic risk. The audit trail is the insurance policy against these events.*

* **The Regulatory Audit:** An external regulator demands proof that a model is fair, compliant, and well-governed. **Our Value:** We provide the non-repudiable evidence required to pass the audit and avoid massive fines.  
* **The Customer Lawsuit:** A customer sues, claiming a decision made by an AI was discriminatory or incorrect. **Our Value:** We provide the ability to reconstruct the specific decision and its reasoning, forming the basis of the legal defense.  
* **The C-Suite Inquiry:** Following a competitor's AI failure, leadership demands immediate assurance that our models are safe and under control. **Our Value:** We provide a real-time, single source of truth for model governance, turning a weeks-long fire drill into a five-minute dashboard review.

## **3\. MVP Core: The Bulletproof Audit Trail**

*The "insurance policy" for every model deployed. This section defines the absolute minimum set of events and data points our system must capture to be considered a viable audit trail.*

### **Minimum Required Events & Data:**

* **Model Ingestion:**  
  * **Data Points:** who (user ID), when (timestamp), source\_commit (Git SHA), model\_version (e.g., v1.2.3).  
* **Data Lineage:**  
  * **Data Points:** A hash or unique identifier (training\_data\_id) of the exact training dataset used.  
* **Performance Snapshot:**  
  * **Data Points:** The core performance metrics (accuracy, f1\_score, precision, recall) at the time of deployment.  
* **Explainability Record:**  
  * **Data Points:** The baseline output of a standard explainability library (e.g., SHAP or LIME) generated at ingestion.  
  * **Notes:** This is critical for defending against legal/regulatory challenges.  
* **Prediction Log:**  
  * **Data Points:** A sampled stream of incoming prediction requests (request\_payload) and the corresponding model outputs (response\_payload).  
  * **Notes:** This provides the specific evidence needed to analyze individual model decisions.

## **4\. User Journey: "A Day in the Life" of Devin the Developer**

*This section helps us build empathy and understand the real-world workflow we are trying to improve. Be as specific and detailed as possible.*

### **4.1. The World BEFORE Our Product**

*Describe Devin's current reality. What is her process for deploying a model?*

* **Her Core Fears & Anxieties:**  
  * "The model is a black box. If it breaks in production, I won't know why."  
  * "I'm worried about being blamed for a model drifting and causing business impact."  
  * "If legal asks me why the model denied a specific customer, I have no way of knowing."  
* **Her Deployment Landscape & Error-Prone Steps:**  
  * **Scenario A: The "Pure DIY" / Status Quo**  
    1. Receives a .pkl file and some performance metrics from the data science team over Slack or email.  
    2. Writes a basic Flask/FastAPI wrapper to serve the model as an API endpoint.  
    3. Manually creates a Confluence page or a README file to document the model version, its deployment date, and the reported metrics. This is immediately out of date.  
    4. Adds basic logging (e.g., print() statements) to the server logs, which captures inputs and outputs but has no context for tracing or explainability.  
    5. Deploys this service to a server (VM, Kubernetes, etc.). There is no formal link between the running process and the source code or data version.  
  * **Scenario B: The "Bottom-Up" Competitor (e.g., Arize, Evidently AI)**  
    1. Devin is told to "integrate the model with Arize."  
    2. She has to instrument her application code, installing their SDK and learning a new, vendor-specific API.  
    3. She must manually define data schemas and ensure the data logged from her service matches what the monitoring tool expects. This is a point of friction and potential error.  
    4. While she gets powerful drift/performance monitoring, the tool is diagnostic, not preventative. The audit trail for *why* a model was deployed is still managed manually in Confluence. The tool only knows what happened *after* deployment.  
  * **Scenario C: The "Top-Down" Competitor (e.g., Databricks, SageMaker)**  
    1. The company has mandated the use of a massive, all-in-one platform like Databricks.  
    2. As a generalist developer, Devin is now forced to operate within a complex, opinionated ecosystem that is foreign to her standard tools (e.g., VS Code, Docker, GitHub Actions).  
    3. She must navigate a labyrinth of proprietary UIs, CLIs, and configuration files just to register and deploy the model. The process is heavyweight and slow.  
    4. The platform's "auditability" is a feature designed for CIOs (checking a box for governance), not for her. It's hard to access and doesn't provide the quick, developer-centric insights she needs to debug a problem at 2 AM.  
* **The "Moment of Truth": Answering a Hard Question**  
  * **The Question:** Her manager asks, *"Legal is on the phone about a customer complaint. Can you tell me exactly why the model rejected their application last Tuesday?"*  
  * **Her Answer (Before):** "I... don't know. The server logs only show that it returned 'false'. I have no idea why. It would take days to try and reproduce the issue."

### **4.2. The World AFTER Our Product**

*Describe Devin's new reality using our tool. How does it integrate into her workflow and solve her problems?*

* **How Our Product Alleviates Her Fears:**  
  * "The audit trail gives me a complete history, so I'm no longer flying blind."  
  * "Real-time alerts mean I'm the first to know if something looks off, not the last."  
  * "I can instantly pull the explainability record for any prediction the model has ever made."  
* **Her New, Streamlined Deployment Workflow:**  
  1. She runs a single, simple command in her existing CI/CD pipeline: mrm-cli deploy model.pkl \--version 1.2.4 \--dataset-id \<hash\>  
  2. Our tool automatically versions the model, generates the performance/explainability snapshots, and creates the immutable audit trail.  
  3. It then deploys the model using a standard, container-based approach she already understands.  
* **The "Moment of Truth": Answering with Confidence**  
  * **The Question:** Her manager asks, *"Legal is on the phone about a customer complaint. Can you tell me exactly why the model rejected their application last Tuesday?"*  
  * **Her Answer (After):** "Yes. One moment. I've just queried the prediction log for that user ID. The model's decision was influenced primarily by \[Factor X and Factor Y\]. I'm sending you the link to the full explainability report now."
